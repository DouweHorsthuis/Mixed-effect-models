# Mixed Models in R

*As coded and explained and created by [Ana Francisco](https://www.cognitiveneurolab.com/dr-ana-a-francisco) and written down and edited by [Douwe Horsthuis](https://github.com/DouweHorsthuis)*

## What are mixed models and why use them

## How to use this R code to create your own mixed models

## The actual code explained

Here we are using a generalized version of the code that you can addapt to use for your own project.

### Loading libraries

You'll need at least these libraries to do the basics, we are also cleaning the enviroment (in case you want to re-run it from the start) and prefenting R from using scientific notations.

```{r loading libraries and basic starting, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lme4)#library for mixed models 
library(lmerTest)#library for P values
library(ggplot2)#library for plotting
library(doBy)#for summaries
library(dplyr)#for many basics 
rm(list=ls())#cleans environment
options(scipen=999)#no scientific notations

```

### Loading data and seeing if it makes sense

We need to load data from a .csv file, or a .text file. We haven't tested, but `library(R.matlab)` and `readMat("filename")` to do the same with a MATLAB file. This file should have a couple of things:

1.  Dependent variable; such as amplitude from trial by trial data from individual subjects

    -   This should be a single value per trial

    -   The more factors you want to include in your model, the more trials you need per participant. If you have too few the model won't complete.

2.  Fixed factor; such as

    -   group, this is different between some people but not all

    -   conditions

3.  Random factor; such as

    -   ID or something that identifies the individual who's data is used, since we know that the data of each individual is always going to be different from the next.

    -   Trial number

## Loading and cleaning the data

```{r loading and checking data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#fill out these 3 variables that will be different depending on your data
load_path="C:/Users/douwe/OneDrive/Documents/Github/Mixed-effect-models/data/"
data_name="p2.txt"
amount_trial= 200 #how many trials do you want to use

dataset_full=read.table(paste(load_path,data_name,sep=""), header=TRUE)#imports data, header=TRUE so we keep names of columns
```

```{r cleaning data}
#re-defines column names
colnames(dataset_full)=c("subjects","group", "group2","condition", "trial","o1","oz","o2","avg")  #give the correct name to each of your columns

#creates factors
dataset_full$subjects=as.factor(dataset_full$subjects)
dataset_full$trial=as.factor(dataset_full$trial)

dataset_full$group2 <- factor (dataset_full$group2, levels = c(1:5), labels = c("CT 22q", "22q-", "22q+", "CT SZ", "SZ"))
dataset_full$condition <- factor (dataset_full$condition, levels = c(1:5), labels = c("145", "245", "495", "995", "2495"))

#checks
#checks
length(unique(dataset_full$subjects))
sort(unique(dataset_full$group2))
sort(unique(dataset_full$condition))
str(dataset_full)

# getting rid of data that is not needed for example
dataset<- subset(dataset_full, select = -c(group, o1, oz, o2))
dataset<- subset(dataset, group2 != "CT 22q" &  group2 != "22q-" &  group2 != "22q+" )

#creates summary-mean and standard deviation
summaryBy(avg ~ subj, data=dataset, FUN=c(length,mean,sd))

#randomly selects x amount trials per subject 
reduceddataset <- dataset %>% group_by(subjects) %>% sample_n(size = amount_trial)
```

## Plotting data

Here we are using ggplot to plot the data. This is an example dataset. This is Go-No-Go data from the IAPS paradigm, where we compare controls and people with schizophrenia. We have different conditions (isi between stimulation).

```{r}
vgp2Plot <- ggplot(reduceddataset, aes(x = group2, y = avg, color=group2)) 
vgp2Plot <- vgp2Plot + theme(legend.key.size = unit(1, "cm"))
vgp2Plot <- vgp2Plot + theme(legend.key.size = unit(1, "cm"))
vgp2Plot <- vgp2Plot + geom_violin() #position = position_nudge(x = .2, y = 0), adjust=1, lwd=1.2, lty=3
vgp2Plot <- vgp2Plot + geom_boxplot(width=0.1, alpha=1, outlier.shape = NA, lwd=1, position=position_dodge(0.5))
vgp2Plot <- vgp2Plot + geom_jitter(width=0.15, alpha = 0.01)
vgp2Plot <- vgp2Plot + scale_color_manual(values=c("snow4", "aquamarine3", "pink", "orange", "purple"))  
vgp2Plot <- vgp2Plot + labs(y = expression(paste("amplitude (",mu,"V)")), x="groups")
vgp2Plot <- vgp2Plot + theme_minimal()
vgp2Plot <- vgp2Plot + theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "grey"),
                             panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
                             panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
                             panel.border = element_blank(),
                             panel.background = element_blank())
vgp2Plot <- vgp2Plot + theme(legend.position = "none")
vgp2Plot <- vgp2Plot + theme(text = element_text(family="sans", size=20))
vgp2Plot <- vgp2Plot + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-30,30))
vgp2Plot
```

## Creating subsets for the model

A mixed effects model should be ran on factors we want to compare with each other, in this case the amplitude for the p2 between the 4 groups. In the case of this example, the 22q group is age matched to their controls, and the sz group has their own. Due to the age difference we should not compare between these groups. So we also need to create subgroups. We also want to be able to look only at a specific condition, so we also separate per conditions

```{r creating subgroups}
vg145_sz <- subset(reduceddataset, condition=="145")
vg245_sz <- subset(reduceddataset, condition=="245")
vg495_sz <- subset(reduceddataset, condition=="495")
vg995_sz <- subset(reduceddataset, condition=="995")
vg2495_sz <- subset(reduceddataset, condition=="2495")

```

## Mixed model

In this example, the depended variable is amplitude, group is a fixed factor, subjects and trial are random factors. We run 6 models, the first 5 look at amplitude by group, the last one also looks at group and condition, because of the \* between group and condition, it will also look for interactions between the two.

```{r mixed models 1.01, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model1.01 = lmer(avg~group2+(1|subjects)+(1|trial), data = vg145_sz, REML=FALSE)
summary(model1.01)
```

We see that the difference **is not significant** for this condition between the groups, we also see that the random effects are not significant

```{r mixed models 1.02, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model1.02 = lmer(avg~group2+(1|subjects)+(1|trial), data = vg245_sz, REML=FALSE)
summary(model1.02)

```

We see that the difference **is significant** for this condition between the groups, we also see that the random effects are not significant

```{r mixed models 1.03, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model1.03 = lmer(avg~group2+(1|subjects)+(1|trial), data = vg495_sz, REML=FALSE)
summary(model1.03)

```

We see that the difference **is significant** for this condition between the groups, we also see that the random effects are not significant

```{r mixed models 1.04, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model1.04 = lmer(avg~group2+(1|subjects)+(1|trial), data = vg995_sz, REML=FALSE)
summary(model1.04)

```

We see that the difference **is significant** for this condition between the groups, we also see that the random effects are not significant

```{r mixed models 1.05, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model1.05 = lmer(avg~group2+(1|subjects)+(1|trial), data = vg2495_sz, REML=FALSE)
summary(model1.05)

```

We see that the difference **is significant** for this condition between the groups, we also see that the random effects are not significant

```{r mixed models 1.06, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model1.06 = lmer(avg~group2*condition+(1|subjects)+(1|trial), data = reduceddataset, REML=FALSE)
summary(model1.06)

```

We see several things here

1.  Overall group is not significant

2.  condition 245 495 995 and 2495 are significant compared to condition 145.

3.  The interactions:

    1.   sz&condition 245 with controls & 145 is not significant

    2.   sz&condition 495 with controls & 145 is not significant

    3.  sz&condition 995 with controls & 145 is significant

    4.  sz&condition 2495 with controls & 145 is significant
